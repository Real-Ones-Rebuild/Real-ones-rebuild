    <h1>About Marquis Owens</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p><strong>I’m Marquis Owens.</strong> I’m a father, a certified peer specialist, a psychologist, a man who spent four years behind bars, and a man who’s now fully free — in mind, in heart, and in purpose.</p>

    <p>I come from pain. I know what it’s like to be fatherless, to be judged, to be addicted, to be overlooked, and to be locked away. But I also know what it’s like to overcome all of it — not because I’m perfect, but because I refused to stay broken.</p>

    <p>I struggled with addiction for years — pills, heroin, and cocaine were the escape. I went to prison. I traded food for Suboxone. I broke my mother’s heart. And for a while, I thought maybe that’s all life had for me.</p>

    <p>But God didn’t leave me there.</p>

    <p>In prison, I got clean. Not just physically — I got clean spiritually, mentally, emotionally. I looked at the man I was and chose to become someone different. I let go of the lies that said I’d never be a father, never be respected, never matter again. And I started rebuilding — one prayer, one truth, one rep, one tear at a time.</p>

    <p>Today, I am the man I needed when I was a child.</p>

    <p>I earned my degree in psychology. I became a certified peer specialist through the Pennsylvania Certification Board. I now work to help others through trauma, addiction, and mental health battles. I know what they feel because I lived it — and made it out.</p>

    <h2>Why I Fight for Fatherhood</h2>
    <p>My son Holden changed everything. He’s the reason I fight every day. I’ve been in a custody battle for him. I’ve stood alone in courtrooms. I’ve had visitations denied, delayed, supervised, and disrespected — but I never stopped showing up.</p>

    <p><strong>HoldenStrong</strong> isn’t just a brand. It’s a vow. A vow that I will never let my son grow up wondering if he mattered. A vow that I’ll break generational cycles. A vow that I’ll be what I never had: a present, powerful, loving father.</p>

    <h2>Why Real Ones Rebuild</h2>
    <p>There are people like me out there — people who’ve been knocked down hard and want to stand up real. People who’ve been told they’re too far gone, but know deep down there’s still something more inside.</p>

    <p><strong>Real Ones Rebuild</strong> is for them. For you. For anyone who’s tired of faking strength and ready to live in truth.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just about success. It’s about substance. It’s about being raw, being real, being resilient. It’s about rebuilding from the rubble and using your pain as the foundation.</p>

    <p>I’m not here to impress you — I’m here to inspire you. To remind you that you are not your past. That your worth isn’t canceled by your worst moment. That you can fall hard and still rise full.</p>

    <p>Because I did. And so can you.</p>

    <p><strong>We rebuild together.</strong></p>
