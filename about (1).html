    <h1>About Marquis Owens</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Real Ones Rebuild isn’t just a brand — it’s a movement born from pain, resilience, and purpose.</p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Marquis Owens</strong>. I'm a Certified Peer Specialist, a mandated reporter, a trained de-escalation professional, and a graduate with a degree in Psychology. But my journey started long before any of that.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a single-parent home, faced the struggles of fatherlessness, and carried childhood trauma I never had words for. I found comfort in football and classrooms where I was often the only Black student in advanced classes. But as life got harder, I turned to drugs — first pills, then heroin and cocaine — chasing numbness instead of healing.</p>
    <p>After years of battling addiction, I was incarcerated in 2017. And while prison took away my freedom, it gave me something more valuable: clarity. I got clean. I confronted my demons. And I found my purpose — to be the father I never had, and to be a light for others still fighting through their darkness.</p>
    <h2>What Real Ones Rebuild Means</h2>
    <p>It means we own our stories. We admit our past without letting it define our future. We fight for healing. For fatherhood. For faith. And we do it together.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just about my comeback — it’s about helping others build theirs. Through speaking, writing, peer support, and this platform, I’m here to show what rebuilding really looks like from the inside out.</p>
    <p><strong>HoldenStrong</strong> — named after my son — is more than a name. It’s a promise to him, and to every parent trying to break the cycle. We don’t quit. We don’t fold. We rebuild together.</p>
