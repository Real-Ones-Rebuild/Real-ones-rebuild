    <h2>About Marquis Owens</h2>
    <p><strong>I’m Marquis Owens</strong> — a father, certified peer specialist, and living proof that pain doesn’t have the final word.<br>
    I didn’t just overcome addiction, prison, and silence — I turned every scar into strength.<br>
    Now, I speak truth, fight for fathers, and build up anyone who's been broken down.<br>
    This is more than a comeback. It’s a movement.<br>
    <strong>Real Ones Rebuild. And we rebuild together.</strong></p>

    <h2>My Story — by Marquis Owens</h2>
    <p>I wasn’t supposed to make it.</p>
    <p>Not according to the system. Not according to the people who counted me out. Not even according to the old version of me — the one who got lost in addiction, ended up behind bars, and thought maybe that was all life had for him.</p>
    <p>But I rebuilt.</p>
    <p>I was addicted to pills, heroin, and cocaine. I lost years of my life to pain I never learned how to talk about. I went to prison, broke, angry, and numb — but inside those walls, something started to shift. I got clean. I got real. And I started finding out who I actually was.</p>
    <p>Since then, I’ve earned my degree in psychology. I became a certified peer specialist in Pennsylvania. I show up every day — not just for myself, but for my son, Holden, who became the reason I breathe. I’ve already stood before the judge in my custody trial. Now, I’m waiting on a decision — praying the court sees the man I’ve become, not the mistakes I’ve made. Because my son deserves to grow up with a father who’s present, committed, and full of purpose.</p>
    <p>That’s what <strong>HoldenStrong</strong> means.</p>
    <p>It’s not just a brand — it’s a promise. A promise to my son that I’ll never stop showing up. A promise to myself that I’ll never return to the life that broke me. And a promise to others that we can rebuild, even when the foundation was shattered.</p>
    <p>This platform — <strong>Real Ones Rebuild</strong> — is bigger than me. It’s for every man who’s been counted out. Every father trying to break generational cycles. Every person who fell hard and still found the strength to rise.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m not perfect. But I’m proof.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We rebuild together.</strong></p>
