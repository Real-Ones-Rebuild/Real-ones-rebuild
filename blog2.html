    <h2>By Marquis Owens</h2>
    <p>Some people survive what they’ve been through.<br><strong>But real ones rebuild.</strong></p>
    <p>They don’t just carry their pain — they shape it into purpose. They don’t just escape the fire — they walk back through it with water for the next man.</p>
    <p>That’s what this movement is about.</p>
    <p>I didn’t build <em>Real Ones Rebuild</em> to show off where I am now. I built it because of where I’ve been. I’ve sat in darkness — addicted, angry, ashamed, behind bars. I’ve lost time, I’ve lost family, I’ve lost parts of myself I thought I’d never get back.</p>
    <p>But I made a choice:<br><strong>To not let brokenness be my legacy.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔨 Rebuilding Is a Revolution</h2>
    <p>This isn’t about fixing cracks — it’s about laying a new foundation.</p>
    <p>Rebuilding means choosing growth over excuses.<br>It means getting up <em>even when you don’t feel like it</em>.<br>It means facing every voice that told you, “You’ll never change” — and proving them wrong <strong>with actions</strong>.</p>
    <p>It’s not for the faint-hearted. It’s for the <strong>real ones</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🧬 What It Means to Rebuild</h2>
    <p>It means being the father you never had.<br>It means being the example your kids can look up to.<br>It means letting go of who you were, to become who you were always meant to be.</p>
    <p>Every day, I wake up with one mission:<br><strong>Be better than yesterday.</strong><br>Not perfect. Just better.<br>Because I’ve got a son watching. And he deserves to see his father rise.</p>

    <h2>🔥 You Can Rebuild Too</h2>
    <p>You are not your charges.<br>You are not your worst decision.<br>You are not the name they tried to put on you.</p>
    <p>You are capable of rebuilding <strong>your life</strong>, your identity, your future.</p>
    <p>So stand up.<br>Wipe your face.<br>Pick up your bricks.</p>
    <p><strong>Because we rebuild together.</strong></p>
