  <article>
    <p>Being a father is the greatest blessing of my life. But being a father in the eyes of the court system — that’s been one of the hardest battles I’ve ever faced.</p>
    <p>I’ve been clean. I’ve done the work. I’ve shown up to every visit, taken every parenting class, passed every test — and still, I’ve had to fight just to be seen as worthy. Just to spend time with my own son.</p>
    <h2>This Is Bigger Than Custody</h2>
    <p>This is about the bond between a father and child. About breaking the cycle of absent fathers and proving that we deserve to be present, too. It’s about raising my son to know that his dad never gave up on him — not once.</p>
    <p>I want other fathers to know: you are not alone. If you’re fighting for your kid — in court, in life, in silence — I see you. This platform is for you, too.</p>
    <p><strong>We rebuild families. We rebuild trust. We rebuild together.</strong></p>
