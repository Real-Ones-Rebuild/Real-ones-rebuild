        My mom, Stephanie Jones ‚Äî known to many as "Stefy J" ‚Äî passed away after a tragic house fire. I had to make the hardest decision of my life: to let her go peacefully. But the truth is, she never left us ‚Äî because what she gave to this world is still moving, still shining, still saving people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stefy J was the kind of woman who would give you the shirt off her back, feed you when you were hungry, or let you stay under her roof when you had nowhere else to go. She didn‚Äôt need to know you well ‚Äî she just needed to know you were in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was a mother to many. A protector. A friend. A quiet hero in a loud world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm sharing her story because I want her legacy to keep going. If she ever helped you, or if you‚Äôve ever known someone like her, I‚Äôm asking you to carry that energy forward. Be the one who shows up. Be the one who feeds, shelters, listens, and loves. Be someone‚Äôs safe place.
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs how we keep her spirit alive. That‚Äôs how we Live Like Stefy J.
      </p>
