    <h1>How I Got Clean in Prison</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>There was a time when I didn’t believe freedom was possible — not just the physical kind, but freedom from addiction, regret, and shame. Prison didn’t save me. But it gave me the stillness to finally face myself.</p>
    <p>I came into jail broken — addicted to heroin, cocaine, pills. Every day was survival. Every choice came from pain. I remember the first week I was there, still withdrawing, still angry, still numb. But something hit me different when I realized I had no more excuses. No more distractions. Just me, my thoughts, and a cell.</p>
    <p>I got clean not because it was easy, but because staying the same was killing me. I started writing again. I started praying. I stopped running. And I began remembering who I used to be — before the drugs, before the chaos, before the pain took over everything.</p>
    <h2>Lessons I’ll Never Forget</h2>
    <p>Prison taught me how to sit with myself. How to hear my own thoughts without judgment. I saw my childhood wounds, my trauma, the false pride I clung to — and I started healing from the inside out.</p>
    <p>People think getting clean is just about quitting drugs. It’s not. It’s about changing the story you believe about yourself. It’s about learning how to feel again — and deciding to live with purpose.</p>
    <p>I’m not perfect. But I’m proof that change is possible. That recovery is real. That the same person who once felt hopeless can become someone others look to for hope.</p>
