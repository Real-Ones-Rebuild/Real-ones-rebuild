      <h2>🎙 What to Expect</h2>
      <p>This podcast is a space for real talk — about life, pain, growth, and redemption. We'll dive into the kind of conversations that usually stay behind closed doors. Every episode is rooted in truth and transformation, offering listeners a raw, unfiltered look into what it means to rebuild your life after addiction, incarceration, and trauma.</p>
