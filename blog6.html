    <h1>Rebuilding the Man I Needed When I Was a Boy</h1>
    <p>I didn’t have a father growing up. Not one that showed me how to be a man, how to handle my emotions, or how to be steady when life shook everything around me.</p>
    <p>I had to learn things the hard way. I had to grow up figuring out pain by feeling it first. I didn’t have a blueprint. No one taught me how to deal with anger without destroying myself. Nobody taught me how to protect my peace or build a future. I was winging it — just trying to survive.</p>
    <p>Now I’m a father.</p>
    <p>And I’m not just trying to be better — I’m rebuilding from the ground up. I’m becoming the man I needed when I was a boy.</p>
    <p>Not for praise. Not for show. But for my son. Because he deserves more than what I had. He deserves a father who doesn’t just <em>show up</em>, but one who’s present, solid, and real — even when it’s hard.</p>
    <p>I’m not perfect, but I’m real about where I came from and where I’m going. I’ve been through courts, addiction, prison, pain — but I’m still standing. I’m still pushing. Still learning. Still healing.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just about being a dad. It’s about breaking cycles. It's about making sure my son doesn’t have to fight the same battles I did. It’s about letting him <strong>see</strong> what growth looks like — not just telling him, but showing him.</p>
    <blockquote>Because if I can become what I needed back then, he won’t have to go searching for it later.</blockquote>
    <p>That’s the mission. That’s the legacy. That’s the rebuild.</p>
