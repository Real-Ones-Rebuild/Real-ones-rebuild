  <section>
    <h2>By Marquis Owens</h2>
    <p>They say the system is supposed to be fair.<br>
    But from the moment I stepped into that courtroom, I felt like I was already losing.</p>
    <p>Not because I was unfit. Not because I was a danger. But because of my past — because of who I used to be. A man who fought addiction. A man who served time. A man they thought didn’t deserve to be a father.</p>
    <p>But they forgot something: <strong>I rebuilt.</strong></p>
    <p>I became a certified peer specialist. I earned a psychology degree. I got clean. I stayed clean. I trained to recognize abuse, de-escalate crisis, and help people transform.<br>
    And most importantly — <strong>I never stopped showing up for my son.</strong></p>

    <h2>🏛️ Court Doesn’t See the Full Story</h2>
    <p>In court, people look at paper.<br>
    But paper doesn’t show the full picture.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t show the hours I sacrificed.<br>
    The pain of missed birthdays.<br>
    The strength it took to face a judge without a lawyer — because I believed my voice mattered.<br>
    It doesn’t show the way I light up when I see my son smile, even for just 3 supervised hours.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t show the <strong>fight in my heart.</strong></p>

    <h2>🧍🏾‍♂️ I’m Not Just Fighting for Custody</h2>
    <p>I’m fighting for his childhood.<br>
    I’m fighting for my presence in his life.<br>
    I’m fighting to make sure my son doesn’t grow up thinking his father didn’t care.</p>
    <p>Because I know what that feels like. I know what it’s like to wonder why your dad didn’t show up.<br>
    And I refuse to let my son carry that wound.</p>
    <p>This isn’t about control. It’s about connection.<br>
    It’s about being there for first steps, scraped knees, bedtime prayers, and real conversations.<br>
    It’s about breaking the cycle I was born into — and building something better.</p>

    <h2>✊🏾 Real Fathers Don’t Walk Away</h2>
    <p>We fight.</p>
    <p>Even when the odds feel stacked.<br>
    Even when the system moves slow.<br>
    Even when they try to define us by our past instead of our progress.</p>
    <p>I am not the man I was.<br>
    I’m the father I was always meant to become.</p>

    <h2>🕊️ If You’re Fighting Too…</h2>
    <p>Don’t give up.</p>
    <p>You may feel alone.<br>
    You may feel silenced.<br>
    But your consistency is louder than any accusation.</p>
    <p>Keep documenting. Keep praying. Keep growing.<br>
    And never stop showing up — in court, in life, in love.</p>
    <p><strong>Because we rebuild together.</strong></p>
