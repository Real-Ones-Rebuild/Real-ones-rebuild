    <h2>By Marquis Owens</h2>
    <p>When I first walked into that prison, I wasn’t just locked up — I was lost.</p>
    <p>Addiction had taken everything from me: my peace, my purpose, my sense of self. I had already tried to stop using before. I had said “this is the last time” more times than I could count. But inside, I still carried pain I never faced — and in that pain, drugs were the silence, the escape, the shield.</p>
    <p>So when I got to prison, it wasn’t like some miracle switch flipped. People in there were still using. And temptation? It was everywhere. Suboxone, strips, drips, whatever you needed — if you wanted it bad enough, you could get it. And for a while, I did.</p>
    <p>I was clean for 7 months before my celly offered me a strip — and I said yes. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t know how to fight that voice in my head that said, “just one time.”</p>
    <p>That “one time” turned into a cycle. I’d buy an 1/8th of a strip for $10, break it into smaller doses, trade food and commissary. Then go through withdrawal. Then do it again.</p>
    <p>Until one day, something snapped in me.</p>
    <p>I looked at the man across from me — older guy, been locked up most of his life, had 7 kids, didn’t take care of any of them, still living like prison was home. That was the moment. I saw my future in him. And I said, “That’s not gonna be me.”</p>
    <p>From that day, I quit. Cold.</p>
    <p>No pills. No drips. No Suboxone. Just God, prayer, pushups, tears, and truth.</p>
    <p>It hurt. Not just physically, but mentally. It forced me to face everything I had been trying to avoid. But it also made me realize something: I wasn’t just getting clean — I was finally getting <strong>clear</strong>.</p>
    <p>I started reading. Writing. I went to every program I could find. I helped other brothers find their way through the fog. And little by little, I rebuilt myself. Day by day.</p>
    <p>That’s when I learned what it means to be a <strong>Real One</strong>.</p>
    <p>Not because you’ve never been down. But because when life knocked you flat, you chose to rebuild.</p>
    <h2>✊🏾 You Can Too</h2>
    <p>If you’re reading this and you’re stuck — in prison, in addiction, in the weight of your past — let me say this:</p>
    <p><strong>It’s not too late. And you’re not too far gone.</strong></p>
    <p>I made it out clean, focused, and driven. And so can you.</p>
    <p>Because <strong>real ones rebuild</strong> — and we rebuild together.</p>
