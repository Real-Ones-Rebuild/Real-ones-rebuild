    <h1>🦋 Blog 7: From Caterpillar to Flight — Why I Relate to a Butterfly</h1>
    <p>I relate to butterflies more than most people would guess. Not because they’re beautiful or admired — but because of <strong>what they had to go through just to become something different</strong>.</p>

    <p>For a long time, I was a caterpillar. Crawling through life, taking what I needed to survive — no direction, no transformation, just instinct. And like a caterpillar, I was hungry for everything. Hungry for escape. Hungry for numbness. Hungry for something to quiet the pain. That’s what addiction looked like for me — <strong>always consuming, never contributing</strong>.</p>

    <p>I didn’t know how to give. I only knew how to take — from people who loved me, from chances I didn’t see, from myself. I was alive, but not living. Just surviving.</p>

    <p>And then prison happened. And as strange as it sounds, <strong>that’s when the cocoon began</strong>.</p>

    <p>Most people think prison is the end of the story. But for me, it became the beginning of a new one. In there, I wasn’t distracted by the outside noise. I had no choice but to sit with myself — with my thoughts, my regrets, my decisions.</p>

    <p>That cocoon wasn’t soft. It was hard. It was made of concrete, metal doors, time, guilt, and pain. But inside that space, <strong>something started to shift</strong>. I read. I prayed. I asked questions I had avoided for years. I <strong>chose to grow</strong>.</p>

    <p>Because I didn’t want to come out of that place the same person I was going in. I wasn’t trying to get out — I was trying to get right.</p>

    <p>And when I finally stepped out of that time in my life, I wasn’t crawling anymore. I wasn’t hungry for destruction. I was hungry for purpose.</p>

    <p>That’s why I call myself a butterfly now. Not because I’m perfect — but because I changed.</p>

    <p>Butterflies give life. They pollinate. They fly. They bring beauty into broken places. And they remind people that transformation is real — that <strong>you don’t have to stay what you were</strong>.</p>

    <p>That’s what I try to do now:<br>
    🌱 Be a light.<br>
    🧱 Rebuild.<br>
    🦋 Give life back where I once drained it.</p>

    <p>So if you're still crawling… If you're still stuck in the hunger or hiding in your own cocoon — don’t give up.<br>
    <strong>Transformation takes time. And sometimes, it takes stillness.</strong></p>

    <p>But when it happens, <br>
    <strong>you won’t be crawling anymore. You’ll be flying.</strong></p>
