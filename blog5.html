    <h1>A Better Us for a Brighter Them</h1>
    <p>Being a single parent is like carrying the weight of the world on your back while trying to keep a smile on your face — for them.</p>
    <p>There are days you feel like you're barely making it. When your own dreams feel like they're on pause. When peace seems far, and rest is a luxury. But then you see their smile… their laugh… that little light in their eyes — and something inside you stands up again.</p>
    <p>That’s not weakness. That’s <strong>purpose</strong>. That’s the reason you’re still fighting.</p>
    <p>The truth is, single parenting is not about perfection — it’s about consistency. It’s about showing up. It’s about rebuilding <em>you</em> so they can have a stronger, safer, more loving version of the one person who never gave up on them.</p>
    <p>We rise, not just for ourselves — but to show our kids that rebuilding is real. That no matter how far life knocked us down, we came back. That love, stability, and peace can grow even from chaos.</p>
    <blockquote>You are not failing. You are rebuilding.<br>And your child? They see you. They feel your love. You’re already giving them more than you know.</blockquote>
    <p>Keep going. The better <strong>you</strong> becomes the foundation for the best <strong>them</strong>.</p>
